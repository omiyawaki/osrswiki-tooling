# Script Fixes and Improvements

This document summarizes the fixes applied to deployment and backup scripts to resolve issues encountered during the deployment process.

## Issues Identified

During deployment on 2025-08-15, several scripts failed with various errors that blocked the workflow:

1. **Validation Scripts**: Looking for `build.gradle` instead of `build.gradle.kts`
2. **Emergency Backup**: Wrong path assumptions and git history corruption
3. **Deployment Scripts**: Git subtree failures due to corrupted history
4. **Quality Gate Scripts**: Missing Android static analysis tasks

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Validation Script Fix (`scripts/shared/validate-deployment.sh`)

**Problem**: Script was checking for `platforms/android/build.gradle` but Android project uses `build.gradle.kts`

**Fix**: Updated validation to check for both file types:
```bash
# Before
if [[ ! -f "platforms/android/build.gradle" ]]; then

# After  
if [[ ! -f "platforms/android/build.gradle.kts" && ! -f "platforms/android/build.gradle" ]]; then
```

### 2. Emergency Backup Script Fix (`scripts/shared/emergency-backup.sh`)

**Problem**: Wrong monorepo path (`/Users/miyawaki/Developer/osrswiki` vs `/Users/miyawaki/Develop/osrswiki`)

**Fix**: Corrected path in backup function:
```bash
# Before
MONOREPO_PATH="/Users/miyawaki/Developer/osrswiki"

# After
MONOREPO_PATH="/Users/miyawaki/Develop/osrswiki"
```

**Problem**: Git bundle creation failing due to corrupted history

**Fix**: Added fallback to tar archive when git bundle fails:
```bash
# Fallback: create tar archive of the repository
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/${bundle_name}.tar.gz" -C "$(dirname "$repo_path")" "$(basename "$repo_path")" 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Legacy Deployment Scripts (Removed)

**Status**: The legacy `deployment/` directory has been removed in favor of the newer `scripts/shared/deploy-*.sh` scripts which provide better safety and reliability.

## Quality Gate Issues

**Problem**: Android project doesn't have `detekt` and `ktlintCheck` tasks configured

**Status**: Not fixed in this session - these tasks are not configured in the Gradle build
**Recommendation**: Either add these tools to the Android project or remove them from quality gate requirements

## Testing Status

All fixed scripts should be tested to ensure they work correctly:

- [ ] `scripts/shared/validate-deployment.sh android` - Should pass with `.gradle.kts` files
- [ ] `scripts/shared/emergency-backup.sh` - Should create backups without path errors

## Benefits

These fixes ensure that:

1. **Deployment workflows are robust** - Multiple fallback mechanisms prevent complete failure
2. **Git history corruption is handled** - Scripts work even with corrupted repository history
3. **Path issues are resolved** - Correct monorepo paths prevent "not found" errors
4. **Modern build systems are supported** - Both `.gradle` and `.gradle.kts` files detected

## Future Improvements

Consider these additional improvements:

1. **Add retry logic** for transient network failures
2. **Implement deployment verification** after successful push
3. **Add progress indicators** for long-running operations
4. **Create deployment rollback procedures** 
5. **Add automated testing** for deployment scripts

## Usage

After these fixes, deployment should be more reliable:

```bash
# These commands should now work reliably
./scripts/shared/validate-deployment.sh android
./scripts/shared/deploy-android.sh
./scripts/shared/deploy-ios.sh
./scripts/shared/deploy-tooling.sh
```

The scripts will automatically fall back to manual deployment methods when git subtree operations fail due to repository corruption or other issues.
