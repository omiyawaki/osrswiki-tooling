# Fixed Worktree Session Approach

## Problem Summary
The previous approach of copying scripts and using `sed` to fix paths created fragile sessions that failed due to:

1. **Path Reference Issues**: Copied scripts still referenced incorrect paths
2. **File Permission Problems**: Scripts couldn't write to session files 
3. **Complexity**: Too many moving parts with sed replacements

## New Wrapper Solution ✅

### **Simplified Approach:**
Instead of copying and modifying scripts, we now create **lightweight wrapper scripts** that simply call the original scripts with correct paths.

### **Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **No path modifications needed** - Original scripts remain untouched
- ✅ **Always uses latest script versions** - No stale copies
- ✅ **Simple and reliable** - Just calls `exec ./scripts/android/script-name.sh "$@"`
- ✅ **No file permission issues** - Scripts run from their original locations
- ✅ **Easy to maintain** - One place to update scripts

### **How It Works:**

1. **Worktree Creation**: `./scripts/shared/create-worktree-session.sh topic-name`
   - Creates git worktree with new branch
   - Creates symlink `scripts-shared -> ../scripts`
   - Generates wrapper scripts in worktree root

2. **Wrapper Scripts**: Each wrapper in the worktree root simply calls the real script:
   ```bash
   # setup-session-device.sh wrapper
   #!/bin/bash
   exec ./scripts/android/setup-session-device.sh "$@"
   ```

3. **Usage**: From worktree directory, run wrappers as before:
   ```bash
   ./setup-session-device.sh    # Calls actual script with correct paths
   ./quick-test.sh              # Calls actual script with correct paths
   source .claude-env           # Works because scripts create files correctly
   ```

### **Files Created in Worktree:**
- `setup-session-device.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/setup-session-device.sh`
- `setup-container-device.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/setup-container-device.sh`
- `get-app-id.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/get-app-id.sh`
- `quick-test.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/quick-test.sh`
- `start-session.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/start-session.sh`
- `test-workflow.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/android/test-workflow.sh`
- `end-session.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/shared/end-session.sh`
- `run-with-env.sh` → wrapper calls `./scripts/shared/run-with-env.sh`

### **Why This Fixes The Issues:**

1. **Path References**: Original scripts run from their intended location, so all relative paths work correctly
2. **File Creation**: Scripts create session files (`.claude-env`, `.claude-session-device`) in the correct worktree directory
3. **App ID Extraction**: `get-app-id.sh` wrapper works correctly because it calls the real script that knows the correct path to `platforms/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
4. **Environment Variables**: All environment variables are set correctly because the original scripts handle them properly

This approach eliminates all the complexity while maintaining the exact same user experience.
